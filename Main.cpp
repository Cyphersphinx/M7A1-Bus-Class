/******************************************************************************
**Write a program that creates a Bus class that includes a bus ID number, 
number of seats, driver ID number, and current speed. 

**Create a default constructor without any parameters that initializes 
the value of ID number, number of seats,and driver ID number.  
(Header file - done / Implementation file -)

**Create another constructor with three parameters of 
bus id number, number of seats, and driver ID Number. 
(Header file - done / Implementation file -)

**Car speed should always be initialized as 0.

**The program will also include the member functions to perform the various 
operations: modify, set, and display bus information 
(Bus id, number of seats, driver ID number, and current speed).

For example:
- Set the bus id number (Header file - done / Implementation file -)
- Set the number of seats (Header file - done / Implementation file -)
- Set of driver initialized number (Header file - done / Implementation file -)
----------------------------------------------------
- Return the bus id number by using get method (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
- Return the number of seats (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
- Return of driver ID 
number (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
- Return the current speed (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
-----------------------
Member function to display the bus information
- busInformation() (Header file - done / Implementation file -)

Also write two member functions, Accelerate() and Brake(). 
**Whenever Accelerate() is called,increase the speed by 5 (cannot exceed 50), and  (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
** whenever Brake() is called, decrease the speed by 5 (cannot be negative).   (Header file -  / Implementation file -)
**Write a program that declares several Bus objects and demonstrates that all the functions work correctly.
